## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn and understand string manipulation in R. Youâ€™ll learn the basics of how strings work and how to create them by hand, but the focus of this chapter will be on regular expressions, or regexps for short (regex for even shorter). Regular expressions are useful because strings usually contain unstructured or semi-structured data, and regexps are a concise language for describing patterns in strings. You'd be surprised how often you'll need to use string manipulation in R, whether for text analysis, efficiently loading data files/objects, or extracting information from the internet or standardized forms.

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L07_strings.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L07.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
